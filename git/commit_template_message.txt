#[<type>](<specifics>) Short commit header

#------------------------------------------------
# Summarize the changes in 50 characters or less

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
# characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
# subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body.

# Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
# are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
# Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
# change? Here's the place to explain them.

# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
#
#  - Bullet points are okay, too
#
#  * Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
#    by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
#    vary here

# [ticket: #<number>]
# See also: #<number>, ...
